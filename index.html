            Tagbilaran City is a port city in a little island in the Philippines.
            I moved to Melbourne when I graduated highschool and it was the best city I've ever lived in. It is still the most liveable city in Australia.
            After moving on from Australia, I moved to LA for a few months and it was a lot to do in that city. It is described as one of the most multicultural city.
